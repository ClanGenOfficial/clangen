Looking around wildly, m_c noticed flailing limbs struggling to keep afloat in the ocean. Diving headfirst into the water, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/bite/bites} into the flailing cat's scruff, who goes limp in m_c's jaws. After what seemed like forever, the two finally felt sand beneath their paws. m_c asks the loner if {PRONOUN/n_c:0/subject}'d like to join c_n, and {PRONOUN/n_c:0/subject} {VERB/n_c:0/nod/nods} excitedly. With gleaming eyes and profuse thank-you's, n_c:0 follows m_c to c_n's camp ",

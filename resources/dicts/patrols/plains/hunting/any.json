            "unscathed_rare": "The rumours are true - it seems to mostly be hunting for tiny mouse prey, not large things, despite it's massive size. This must be a maned wolf, and just being able to name the odd thing makes it feel so much less threatening. The cats remind each other of the tales sometimes shared in the nursery, of the tallest predator on the plains being one of the shyest.",

The weird creature skitters away from the incoming patrol, trotting off in a tangle of too long legs."

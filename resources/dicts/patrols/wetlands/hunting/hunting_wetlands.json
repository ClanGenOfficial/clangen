It's a wild ride through the swamp until the fox bucks them off, but it wins them the fish carcass.",

But then they're stuck, unwilling to let go and risk being bitten. They're dragged through the swamp, over rocks and through bushes, until the fox finally collapses and the battered s_c goes back to proudly claim the fish."

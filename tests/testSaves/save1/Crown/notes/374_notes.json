  "374": "<br><b>Personality<\/b><\/br><p><br>Although Hookleap and Driftstar, formerly Driftfur, were rivials during their kithood moons, it was often on friendly terms, as the two brothers had a strange, but powerful bond! Having nothing but respect for each other gained the brothers to control their clan with Driftstar's mighty voice, and Hookleap's tremendious streght and vigor, there was nothing that could topple Wolfclan with the two brothers harssing the enemies.<\/br><\/p><p><br>A tight, unweavering loyality to his leader, his clanmates, and his belif in Starclan, he knows he is in good hands as Gingaclan's deputy. Although, he wishes he could hold the position as Gingaclan's leader, Hookleap frimly believes and trust in his little brother's leadership, and proudly stand beside him whenever Driftstar needs an intimidating brute in battle!<\/br><\/p><p><br>Alike as his little brother, Hookleap isn't much of words, but more so in actions. Having a more bulkier and heavier stucture than most in his clan, he rather allow his eyes and ears do the talking for him, not caring to correct others on whatever is on his barren expressions. Regradless, everyone knows one firm thing about Hookleap his heart a ablaze in battle, and would throw himself in any harm's way as it means to protect those he loves dearly.<\/br><\/p> "

"""

 Please dont put this *unittest* in the tests/unittest github action.
 It is only for local use.
HOWEVER
 Please keep the raw python script, so it can be run by the tests/encoding_test github action.

Alternatively to Python, the 'file' command on linux can also check encoding.

This test isn't because we can't use utf-8 characters, but because we shouldn't
use them accidentally without explicitly setting the encoding.

Suggested commands to find the offending character:
file -i old_file.txt
iconv -cf utf-8 -t ascii -o old_file.txt new_file.txt
diff old_file.txt new_file.txt"""
